## Important notes

The project is primarily intended to showcase my way of thinking. Within the project, some code snippets and components have not been developed according to production-level code quality principles. For example, despite being outsourced into separate components, the table and modal don't entirely receive data from the outside, thus they are not reusable. Such solutions also include, for instance, the Svg hover-filter, the lack of separate pagination and snackbar components, etc...

The active menu indicator (small white triangle) can be tested between the Inbox and Outbound menu items. The rest of the menu options leads to a 404 page.

## Functionality

- Edit existing users
- Add new users
- Delete users
- Bulk delete users
- Multiselect users (checkbox)
- Form validation
- Sort by Name or Permission (asc & desc)
- Dynamic pagination
- Menu navigation (with active menu indicator)
- Fully responsive
- 404 page

## Install

1. Clone the repo, or download it as a zipfile, and extract it
2. cd into the downloaded directory then run this command to install the dependencies

```bash
npm install / yarn install
```

3. Start the project on the local server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Itâ€™ll start the app on http://localhost:5173
